  <h2>My Favorite Foods </h2>
  <div>
  <p> Some of my favorite foods include Pizza, Lobster, and Pulled pork. I like Pizza because of all the different variation that you can make. Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza by the way. Come on, get your head together. I like Lobster because of all the ways you can use it. I love it especially in Ravioli. I like pulled pork sandwiches because, just simply, it tastes good. It's just good.</p>
