  <h1>What I love</h1>
  <h2>I love sports in general, I just need to understand them. The sports I love the most are soccer, basketball, and football. I have played soccer for the past couple years and this year I'm doing the same. I don't watch a lot of soccer, besides the world cups. I watch more of football and basketball. I know a lot about basketball and football. If you showed me an image of players from basketball adn football I could name probably 90% of them. Another thing I love or hate is school. Me and school have a love hate reltionship because of the people inside of the school. I love going to school to see my friends, but I hate or very much dislike the projects. I got all A's last year, but it was a struggle. I also love my family very much. Click<a href="Goats.html">here</a>for my other site</h2>
