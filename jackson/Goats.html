    <p>Magic Johnson tooken 1 overall in the 1979 draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. He changed the game by being a 6'9 point guard, and had incredible courst vision averaging 11 assist throughout is career. He was the most versatile not having a jumper, but back then a jumper wasn't needed. He also didn't score at very high rates never averaging over 24 points for a season. His real name is Ervin Johnson but he's called Magic because of what he can do on the court.</p>

    <h4>Kobe Bryant</h4>
  <p>Kobe was drafted in 1996 by the Charlotte Hornets 13th overall. Kobe was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets, but ended up being traded a few mintues later to the Los Angeles Lakers. Charlotte would end up this, because Kobe is one of the most clutch players of all time. Kobe had one of the most complete all around games. He could shoot, defend, drive, dribble, anything you want he could do it all. The 1996 draft is considered one of the best drafts of all time due to Kobe. By the end of his career Kobe and achieved, one MVP, 5 championships, and two Final MVP's. </p>
